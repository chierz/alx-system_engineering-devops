When you enter https://www.google.com into your browser and hit Enter, a captivating sequence of events unfolds in the background, involving multiple layers of technology and protocols that collaborate to deliver the webpage to your screen. Let’s dissect these steps in detail. The details will be broken down into 8 numbered steps which outline the most important amongst several other things that are going on in the background.
Domain Name System (DNS) Request:
The journey commences with the DNS request. DNS acts as the internet’s address book, translating human-friendly domain names like www.google.com into IP addresses that computers can comprehend and utilize to locate other computers on the network.

Browser Cache: Initially, the browser checks its cache to determine if it has recently resolved this domain name.
Operating System Cache: If the browser cache lacks the information, it checks the operating system's cache.
Router Cache: If unresolved, it queries the router’s DNS cache.
ISP (Internet Service Provider) DNS Server: If none of the caches contain the IP address, the request is forwarded to the ISP's DNS server.
Recursive Query: The ISP DNS server conducts recursive queries, commencing from the root DNS servers, then the Top-Level Domain (TLD) servers, and ultimately the Authoritative DNS servers, ensuring your computer connects to the correct website, in this case, google.com.
IP Address Retrieval: Once resolved, the IP address is relayed back to the browser swiftly.
Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) Connection:
Armed with the IP address, the browser proceeds to establish a connection to the Google server using TCP/IP. This protocol ensures reliable communication between the device and the server. It does this by initiating a three-way handshake:

SYN: The browser dispatches a SYN (synchronize) packet to the server.
SYN-ACK: The server responds with a SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledge) packet.
ACK: The browser sends an ACK (acknowledge) packet back to the server.
Firewall:
During the TCP/IP connection process, firewalls on both ends may scrutinize the packets to ensure compliance with security policies:

Client Firewall: Verifies that outgoing traffic is authentic.
Server Firewall: Inspects incoming traffic to safeguard against malicious requests.
HTTPS/SSL:
If the URL starts with HTTPS, then SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) encryption is employed to secure the communication:

TLS Handshake: The browser and server exchange asymmetric encryption keys (public and private keys) via the TLS handshake, guaranteeing encrypted and secure data transfer.
Certificate Validation: The browser authenticates the server’s SSL certificate, ensuring communication with the legitimate Google server.
Load Balancer:
Once the secure connection is established, the request reaches Google’s infrastructure. Due to Google’s vast operations, a load balancer is utilized to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers:

Load Distribution: The load balancer employs various algorithms (e.g., round-robin, least connections, IP Hash) to ensure optimal server handling, balancing the incoming load of requests, and ensuring high availability and reliability.
Types of Load Balancers:

Hardware Load Balancers: These are physical devices specifically designated for the task of load balancing. Instances include F5 Networks and Citrix ADC.
Software Load Balancers: These are software applications capable of operating on conventional hardware or cloud environments. Examples include Nginx, HAProxy, and Amazon Elastic Load Balancer (ELB).
Advanced Features of Load Balancers:

Health Checks: Load balancers conduct regular health checks on servers within the pool to confirm their capacity to handle requests. Servers deemed unhealthy are temporarily excluded from the pool until they recuperate.
SSL Termination: Load balancers manage SSL decryption, relieving backend servers of this resource-intensive duty, enhancing performance by lessening the SSL processing burden on individual servers.
Session Persistence: Ensures that requests from the same user (session) are consistently directed to a singular server, which is valuable for applications where user session data is stored on the server.
Global Server Load Balancing (GSLB): Distributes traffic among servers positioned in diverse geographical regions, enhancing performance by steering users towards the closest server and providing redundancy in the event of regional outages.
Web Server:
The chosen server now processes the request:

HTTP Request Handling: The web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache) receives the request and determines how to process it. For static content (e.g., images, CSS files), the web server may directly serve the files from the filesystem.
Reverse Proxy: Web servers can also act as a reverse proxy, forwarding client requests to the appropriate backend services.
Application Server:
For dynamic content, the request is directed to an application server:

Dynamic Processing: The application server (e.g., a server executing code in Python, Java, Node.js, etc.) processes the request, executing business logic, user authentication, or other intricate operations.
Database:
If the request necessitates data retrieval or storage, the application server interacts with the database through database querying:

Query Execution: The application server executes SQL or NoSQL queries to retrieve or update data in the database.
Data Retrieval: The database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB) processes these queries and furnishes the requisite data.
Response:
Subsequently, the application server dispatches the processed data to the web server, which then assembles the final HTML response and transmits it through the secure TCP connection to your browser.

Rendering of the Document Object Model (DOM):
Upon reception of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, your browser decodes and renders the webpage. The DOM is structured from the HTML, styles are implemented from the CSS, and interactive functionalities are activated by JavaScript, resulting in the fully rendered webpage where the final pixels are displayed as observed.

Detailed Steps in DOM Rendering:

Parsing HTML: The browser analyzes HTML tags and constructs a DOM tree, representing the hierarchical structure of the document.
Parsing CSS: Simultaneously, parsing CSS generates a CSS Object Model (CSSOM), associating CSS rules with pre-existing HTML elements in the DOM.
Building the Render Tree: The browser combines the DOM and CSSOM to form a render tree that includes elements necessitating display and their respective styles, essential for determining the page layout.
Layout Calculation: The render tree is used to calculate the exact position and size of each element on the page.
Painting: The ultimate stage translates the render tree into pixels on the screen. This process may utilize layers for sophisticated rendering effects such as 3D object representation.
Optimizations for Better Performance:

Minimizing Reflows and Repaints: Efficient JavaScript and CSS can significantly reduce the number of reflows and repaints, enhancing performance.
Browser Caching: Caching resources like HTML, CSS, JavaScript files, and images speeds up subsequent visits to the same website.
Lazy Loading: Deferring the loading of non-critical resources (like images) until they are needed enhances initial load times and improves overall performance.
