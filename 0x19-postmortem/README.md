# Web Stack Debugging Project - Postmortem

## Overview

This project is a detailed postmortem analysis of an issue encountered in a web application where users experienced significant slowdowns due to an unoptimized database query during a traffic surge. The postmortem includes an issue summary, timeline of events, root cause analysis, resolution steps, and corrective measures to prevent future occurrences.

## Content Summary

### 1. **Issue Summary**
   - **Duration:** 3 hours 30 minutes (08/15/2024 3:00 PM - 6:30 PM UTC)
   - **Impact:** Slower load times affecting 70% of users, leading to a drop in user engagement.
   - **Root Cause:** Unoptimized database query causing a bottleneck under heavy traffic.

### 2. **Timeline**
   - A chronological sequence of events detailing how the issue was detected, investigated, and resolved.

### 3. **Root Cause and Resolution**
   - **Root Cause:** Detailed explanation of the poorly optimized database query and how it led to the performance degradation.
   - **Resolution:** Steps taken to optimize the query and restore normal functionality.

### 4. **Corrective and Preventative Measures**
   - **Improvements Needed:** Overview of what needs to be fixed or improved.
   - **Specific Tasks:** A list of actionable items, such as auditing database queries, enhancing monitoring, and improving scalability.

## How to Use This Documentation

This README and accompanying postmortem document are intended for:
- **Developers and Engineers:** To understand the technical details of the issue and the steps taken to resolve it.
- **Project Managers:** To gain insights into the timeline of events and the impact on users.
- **Quality Assurance Teams:** To use the corrective measures as guidelines for future testing and optimization.
- **DevOps Teams:** To apply lessons learned in monitoring and infrastructure scalability.

## Lessons Learned

This postmortem highlights the importance of:
- **Regular Database Optimization:** Ensuring that queries are efficient and can handle large datasets.
- **Scalability Planning:** Preparing the system to handle unexpected traffic surges without compromising performance.
- **Proactive Monitoring:** Implementing comprehensive monitoring tools to detect and address issues before they impact users.

## Next Steps

Based on the findings, we recommend:
